1.Nightmare- Nightmare is a survival horror game made by a team of two. The game puts you the main character inside a forest
filled with skinwalkers who are in search for you. The objective of the game is to escape the forest by searching in the nearby 
buildings for gasoline to refill your while also helping other npc's escape with you.

NOTE: This is a work in progress project, what is shown here is the current state of what we've made.
